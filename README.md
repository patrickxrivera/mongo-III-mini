# Mongo III Mini Sprint

## Topics

* Relational Documents in Mongo via the
  [Populate Method](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/populate.html)
* Model / Controller / Routes organization

## Running the Project

* `cd` into your project directory
* `npm install` to install dependencies
* Run `mongod` to start your Mongo server from your root directory or create a
  `data` directory in this project and run `mongod --dbpath data` to point your
  DB to your local directory.

## Mongoose's Populate Method

For this mini sprint, there are two models we'll be utilizing: the Post model
and the Comment model. The Comment model depends upon the Post model. You'll
notice that the in the Post model schema we have this line

```
comments: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.Number, ref: 'Comment' }]
```

This line specifies the `comments` field on the Post schema, which is an array
populated by comment IDs. This is where the `populate()` method that Mongoose
provides comes in. When we fetch a post, we want to also see all of its
associated comments on the posts that we get back from the database. Without
running `populate()`, our posts would come back with an array of just IDs of all
of their comment children, without the comments' actual data. Here's an example
of running the `populate()` command

```
Post.findById(3).exec()
	.then((post) => {
		post.populate('comments');
		res.send(post);
	}
```

## Model / Controller / Routes Organization

Take a look at how the files in this sprint are organized. The model directory
holds the schemas. The routes directory specifies all of the routes of our
little API. The controller directory holds all of the logic that needs to be
executed upon querying individual endpoints.

Think of this style of organization as analogous to the Model / View /
Controller paradigm that is still commonly used in front end applications. It's
just a way of organizing and modularizing different parts of what our project
needs to do in a logical fashion. Organizing your code in this way makes it
easier to find files in the future when a project scales and becomes much larger
in terms of sheer number of lines of code. Also, a developer without any prior
knowledge of the project can look around and orient themselves much more easily
with an organization pattern such as this.

## Todos

* Implement all of the different controller methods in the
  `controllers/postControllers.js` file.
* Test your implementation locally on your Mongo server with either Postman, or
  via your terminal.
